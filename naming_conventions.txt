Naming Conventions :

1) All php variables should start with small letters.
2) Control statements should have one space between the control keyword and opening parenthesis, to distinguish them from function calls.
3) Always use curly braces even in situations where they are technically optional. Having them increases readability and decreases the likelihood of logic errors being introduced when new lines are added.
4) Functions should be called with no spaces between the function name, the opening parenthesis, and the first parameter; spaces between commas and each parameter, and no space between the last parameter, the closing parenthesis, and the semicolon.
5) Arrays should be formatted with a space separating each element (after the comma), and spaces around the => key association operator.
6) String Concatenations : Always use a space between the dot and the concatenated parts to improve readability.
